Today I told myself I was going to learn to code my own blog to do as a project.
I started with simple HTML googled a lot of stuff and in the end I did not like
the result. I still lack the knowledge to make a crazy looking blog but in time
I will.

So I did what every person does in 2025. "Hey Claude how in
the hell do you make a blog" of course I provided links to blogs I liked. And 30
mins later bam it was done! Not great but better than what I can ever do. I will
probably go back and make changes of course. As of right now the theme follows
one of the Omarchy Themes Matte Black, but still lacks a lot.I can improve it for sure over time.

I think it is crazy to think that in some cases AI is great. In situations like this I can say it is great. In other situations I spend more time arguing with it than it actually helping me. One fatal flaw of AI is that you ask a question like hey
how do I do this? An in most cases it just starts working making documents or
whatever it thinks you need which is great in a sense but again I only asked how
to do it not do it for me.

Well that is so far my experience coding with AI. I know enough to get started
but not enough to not need it. The crazier thing is I am using a Mac and typing
all this in LazyVim I know shocker. Little by little I will be a full computer
nerd using Linux and Ricing my computer, but until then I will just use this.

Thank you for reading! Hope you read the next one.

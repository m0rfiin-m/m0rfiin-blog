            <p>Today I told myself I was going to learn to code my own blog to do as a project.
I started with simple HTML googled a lot of stuff and in the end I did not like
the result. I still lack the knowledge to make a crazy looking blog but in time
I will.</p>
<p>So I did what every person does in 2025. &ldquo;Hey Claude how in
the hell do you make a blog&rdquo; of course I provided links to blogs I liked. And 30
mins later bam it was done! Not great but better than what I can ever do. I will
probably go back and make changes of course. As of right now the theme follows
one of the Omarchy Themes Matte Black, but still lacks a lot.I can improve it for sure over time.</p>
<p>I think it is crazy to think that in some cases AI is great. In situations like this I can say it is great. In other situations I spend more time arguing with it than it
actually helping me. One fatal flaw of AI is that you ask a question like hey
how do I do this? An in most cases it just starts working making documents or
whatever it thinks you need which is great in a sense but again I only asked how
to do it not do it for me.</p>
<p>Well that is so far my experience coding with AI. I know enough to get
started but not enough to not need it. The crazier thing is I am using a Mac and
typing all this in LazyVim I know shocker. Little by little I will be a full
computer nerd using Linux and Ricing my computer, but until then I will just use
this.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading!
Hope you read the next one.</p>

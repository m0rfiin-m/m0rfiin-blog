      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I told myself I was going to learn to code my own blog to do as a project.&#xA;I started with simple HTML googled a lot of stuff and in the end I did not like&#xA;the result. I still lack the knowledge to make a crazy looking blog but in time&#xA;I will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I did what every person does in 2025. &amp;ldquo;Hey Claude how in&#xA;the hell do you make a blog&amp;rdquo; of course I provided links to blogs I liked. And 30&#xA;mins later bam it was done! Not great but better than what I can ever do. I will&#xA;probably go back and make changes of course. As of right now the theme follows&#xA;one of the Omarchy Themes Matte Black, but still lacks a lot.I can improve it for sure over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
